# mindovermind
Hack Brooklyn project, Mind Over Mind prioritizes mental health issues and tries to combat them, especially for those that are mentally struggling due to COVID-19.

## Inspiration
There are many teenagers and students that suffer mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, etc. Due to the quarantine, these people probably cannot get the help they need. We want to provide a safe space for these people and let them know that people are here for them.

## What it does
Darren and Jessica sought to create a mental health web application that encourages others and lifts spirits, shows how mental health affects others, brings awareness for those with mental health issues, and encourages them to attend events geared towards them. 

## How I built it
We used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. We also collaborated on our workflow using Git.

## Challenges I ran into
It was really hard for us to originally find the motivation to work on a project due to depression from not being able to go outside and explore this beautiful city. For Jessica, it was really hard for her to stay motivated and happy, and she was developing a lot of anxiety and the quarantine was taking a genuine toll on her. She wanted to overcome this and try to be the best version of herself, and that's how she found the motivation to work on this hack!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are both proud of the fact that we were both willing to get out of our comfort zones and work on something that means a lot to us. We are both proud of each other that we were able to work on something to inspire others.

## What we learned
We both were able to refine on a lot of our previous front-end development skills. Since the quarantine, we were completely demotivated. Now, we feel a lot more passionate and motivated and excited about what the future has in store for us.

## What's next for Mind Over Mind
Darren and I will definitely continue to work on this project after Hack Brooklyn. This is a passion project of ours and we would love to see it go far <3
